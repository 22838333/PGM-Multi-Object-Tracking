# PGM-Multi-Object-Tracking
Accumulated source code for NN + PGM solution to multiple object tracking problem in image sequences

This is a repository containing the majority of the source code written for the purposes of performing multiple object tracking on image sequences.

It relies on libraries which are not publically available at the time of writing and as such is unfortunately not compilable as is.
